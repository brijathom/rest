# Rest

A basic REST API created with Spring. The API is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Data is stored in a MongoDB database. The API has a GET method which retrieves data for a specified country from a MongoDB database. An example GET request is set up on ReqBin at the link below. Information for other countries can be obtained by specifying the three letter country code value at the end of the URL. Information for all countries can be requested by changing the query at the end of the URL to "get-all".
