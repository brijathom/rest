# Rest

A basic REST API created with Spring and deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The API has two GET methods that retrieve general country data from a MongoDB database. An example GET request for a specfic country is set up on ReqBin at the link below. Information for other countries can be obtained by specifying the three letter country code value at the end of the URL. A GET request to retrieve information for all countries can be created by changing the query at the end of the URL to "get-all".
