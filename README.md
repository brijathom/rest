# Rest

A basic REST API created with Spring. The API is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Data is stored in a MongoDB database. The API has two
GET methods. An example GET request is set up on ReqBin at the link below. Information for other countries can be obtained by specifying the
three letter country code value at the end of the URL. Information for all countries can be requested by changing the query at the end of the URL to "get-all".
